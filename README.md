# Version 3 of my portfolio
This is my third attempt of making an interesting portfolio to help me get a job in web development.
## There are several things I must accomplish with this attempt:
 - [x] Create/Research art and assets to be used in 
 - [x] Parallax Effect logic;
 - [x] Wave Effect on the middle of the landing page on screen;
 - [x] Gradient Effect on scrolling down on the page ( A gradient of sorts that shows how "deep" you are );
 - [x] My Face on a lifebuoy, floating on top of the waves;
 - [x] A data.js file, that contains all my skills;
 - [x] A data.js file, that contains which kinds of interactible items will be in the water (svgs);
 - [x] A Life Buoy Icon with an animation to go to the start of the page;
 - [x] A fixed side bar with my Github, Linkedin, Whatsapp and email;
 - [x] A simple header, with a strong contrast with the page;
 - [x] A simple footer, with my Credentials and simple additional contact info;
 - [ ] Create a Modal component to overlay the screen when touched (don't forget the X button);
 - [ ] Create a simple reusable component that can get information from both datasets to create interactible objects;
 - [ ] Corals on the sides (parallaxed) hiding more interactions;
 - [ ] Treasure chest in the end of the page that reveals a bubble with one more chance to contact me;
 - [ ] Add ocean sounds that change depending on how deep you are ( 2 to 3 different sounds) ;
 - [ ] Add disable sound and disable animations buttons ( Disabled as default );
 - [ ] Review typography;
## Responsiveness Goals:
 - [x] Wave Responsiveness;
 - [x] Sidebar disappear to use header space + fix header on page;
 - [ ] Item Responsiveness;
## Bugfixes:
 - [x] Fix Wave bug with `overflow-x:hidden` on body tag (mobile).
 - [x] Fix Gmail Icon and make hover effects on overlay.
 - [x] Fix image sizes in mobile version.
