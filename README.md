# Version 3 of my portfolio
This is my third attempt of making an interesting portfolio to help me get a job in web development.
## There are several things I must accomplish with this attempt:
 - [x] Create/Research art and assets to be used in 
 - [x] Parallax Effect logic;
 - [x] Wave Effect on the middle of the landing page on screen;
 - [x] Gradient Effect on scrolling down on the page ( A gradient of sorts that shows how "deep" you are );
 - [x] My Face on a lifebuoy, floating on top of the waves;
 - [x] A data.js file, that contains all my skills;
 - [x] A data.js file, that contains which kinds of interactible items will be in the water (svgs);
 - [x] A Life Buoy Icon with an animation to go to the start of the page;
 - [x] A fixed side bar with my Github, Linkedin, Whatsapp and email;
 - [x] A simple header, with a strong contrast with the page;
 - [x] A simple footer, with my Credentials and simple additional contact info;
 - [x] Create a Modal component to overlay the screen when touched;
 - [x] Create a simple reusable component that can get information from both datasets to create interactible objects;
 - [x] Corals on the bottom of the page;
 - [x] Add a simple content section to have without the modals;
 - [x] Add interactible items in the background that open the modal;
 - [ ] Diversify the items;
 - [ ] Animate the items;
 - [x] Add language change button;
 - [ ] Review typography;
