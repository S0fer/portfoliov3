# Version 3 of my portfolio
This is my third attempt of making an interesting portfolio to help me get a job in web development.
## There are several things I must accomplish with this attempt:
 - [ ] Create/Research art and assets to be used in 
 - [ ] Parallax Effect with non - interactible items - Just the logic;
 - [ ] Parallax Effect with Interactible items ( Like a clickable div, or a div with a hover effect ) - Just the logic;
 - [ ] Z-index on every object on screen `!important`;
 - [ ] Interpolate z-index with the parallax effect;
 - [ ] Gradient Effect on scrolling down on the page ( A gradient of sorts that shows how "deep" you are );
 - [ ] Wave Effect on the middle of the landing page on screen;
 - [ ] My Face on a boat, floating on top of the wave;
 - [ ] A data .js file, that contains which kinds of interactible items will be in the water;
 - [ ] A system to randomly asign the data into objects/divs on the page;
 - [ ] A Life Buoy Icon with an animation to go to the start of the page;
 - [ ] A fixed side bar with my Github, Linkedin, Whatsapp and email;
 - [ ] A simple header, with a strong contrast with the page;
 - [ ] A simple footer, with my Credentials and simple additional contact info;
 - [ ] Corals on the sides (parallaxed) hiding more interactions;
 - [ ] Treasure chest in the end of the page that reveals a bubble with one more chance to contact me;
 - [ ] Add ocean sounds that change depending on how deep you are ( 2 to 3 different sounds) ;
 - [ ] Add disable sound and disable animations buttons ( Disabled as default );
 - [ ] Review typography;
## Responsiveness Goals:
 - [ ] Wave Responsiveness;
 - [ ] Item Responsiveness;
 - [ ] Sidebar disappear to use header space + fix header on page;
 - [ ] Disable :hover effects while mobile ( performance );
 - [ ] Add simple animations to interactible items to stand-out ( lack of hover effects );
